# Semantic Versioning, Improved

[semver](https://semver.org) too complicated? Consider new_semver. These are the two rules:

  1. Each instance of `new_` at the beginning of a package name increments the major version.
  2. Each instance of `_fix` at the end of a package name increments the minor version.
   
Pros:

  - Easy to learn.
  - Somebody on your team is already doing this.

Cons:

  - There are no cons.
  - `new_new_new_new_new_new_mypackage_fix_fix_fix` says hi.
